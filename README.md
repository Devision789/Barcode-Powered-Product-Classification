# Barcode-Powered-Product-Classification

# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a barcode-based product classification system that streamlines inventory management and product organization. By leveraging barcode scanning technology, the system efficiently categorizes products, facilitating seamless inventory tracking, product retrieval, and overall warehouse management.

# Key Features
Barcode Recognition: Accurately identifies product barcodes using image recognition algorithms.

Product Classification: Automatically assigns products to predefined categories based on barcode information.

Inventory Management: Simplifies inventory tracking by maintaining an updated database of product quantities and locations.

Product Search and Retrieval: Enables quick and easy product retrieval based on barcode scans or product information.

# Benefits
Enhanced Inventory Accuracy: Reduces inventory discrepancies and improves stock management.

Streamlined Product Organization: Facilitates efficient product organization and retrieval.

Optimized Warehouse Operations: Streamlines warehouse processes and reduces labor costs.

Improved Product Visibility: Provides real-time insights into product availability and location.

# Usage
Product Registration: Register products in the system by scanning their barcodes and providing relevant information.

Barcode Scanning: Scan product barcodes to identify and classify products.

Inventory Management: Access and update inventory information, including product quantities and locations.

Product Search: Retrieve products based on barcode scans or product details.
